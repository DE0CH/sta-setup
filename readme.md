# Introduction
The machines in the labs can be a pain in the ass to work with sometimes especially with broken gcc complier, no package manager, chsh to zsh does not work. This script tries to side step the problem with homebrew, which can install packages in userspace. It also comes with some (opinionated) niceties like oh-my-zsh, syntax highlighting and auto completion, which I find very useful in my daily lives.

1. Clone this repo
```bash 
$ git clone https://github.com/de0ch/sta-setup.git
